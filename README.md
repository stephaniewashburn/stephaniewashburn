# Hi, I'm Stephanie! Data Analyst, [Psychology/Cognitive Neuroscience Researcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-washburn-58457a216/)

<h2>👨‍💻 Data Projects:</h2>

- <b>Machine Learning / Python</b>
  - Aviation Flight Risk Forecasting (NASA ASRS) – Built SARIMAX and time series models to forecast aviation safety incident trends from NASA’s ASRS dataset. Preprocessed raw reports, engineered features, and evaluated models with RMSE/MAE to assess predictive performance, providing insights into 2024–2025 risk factors.
  - Education Program Forecasting – Developed machine learning pipelines to forecast future cohorts for a non-profit education mentorship program. Implemented one-hot encoding and Ridge regression, optimized hyperparameters, and delivered interpretable results to support organizational planning.
  
- <b>SQL</b>
  - Website Engagement Analytics (Google Analytics Sample Data) – Queried BigQuery sample data to calculate user retention, conversion funnels, and traffic trends, demonstrating how SQL can uncover actionable business insights.
  - COVID-19 Trends Analysis (Our World in Data) – Used SQL to aggregate and compare global case counts, vaccination rates, and mortality trends across countries, highlighting the use of SQL for public health monitoring and time-series reporting.

- <b>R</b>
  - Deepfake Image Detection (fMRI + Behavioral Data) – Cleaned and analyzed multimodal datasets to study how participants detect AI-generated deepfake faces. Applied GLM modeling in R and FreeSurfer-derived brain data to identify neural correlates of detection accuracy.
  - Life Sampling Data Cleaning (Longitudinal Aging Study) – Processed and harmonized millions of observations from ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Built R pipelines to clean, filter, and visualize high-frequency time-series data, enabling downstream statistical modeling of age-related decision-making.
